    biography: `Hello, I'm Stompy Mwendwa, a Senior DevOps & Platform Reliability Engineer with over 7 years building and scaling cloud infrastructure for enterprise SaaS platforms across global markets. My focus is simple: bridge the gap between development and operations to keep systems reliable, uptime optimal, and infrastructure automation smooth so businesses can scale without the headaches.

Over the years, I've worked across some pretty complex environments. At Sourcegraph, I've been managing platform operations across three continents, which led to cutting incident resolution time by 34% through smarter automation and better monitoring with Prometheus. We've kept 99.9% service availability for our enterprise customers, and I've personally handled 62% of high-severity production incidents in our follow-the-sun support model. Before that at IQVIA, I drove technical onboarding across EMEA that resulted in a 33% revenue bump, integrated platforms for 20+ enterprise clients worth $10M in annual contracts, and helped drop customer churn from 8% down to under 3%. Earlier in my career at Kenya's ICT Authority, I led migrating seven government platforms to Azure while keeping 99.99% uptime and slashing land approval processing times by 80%.

My day-to-day involves Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines across AWS, Azure, and GCP. I write automation scripts in Python, Bash, Go, and TypeScript, and rely heavily on Grafana, Prometheus, and Sentry to keep tabs on system health. I'm fluent in English and Swahili with conversational Spanish, which has been helpful working with multicultural teams. After four years of remote work across different time zones, I've learned how to make asynchronous collaboration actually work.

I hold certifications as a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), Google Cloud Associate Engineer, AWS Cloud Practitioner, and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals. I graduated from Strathmore University with a degree in Computer Science, and I make it a point to stay current with cloud-native tech and infrastructure best practices.`,
